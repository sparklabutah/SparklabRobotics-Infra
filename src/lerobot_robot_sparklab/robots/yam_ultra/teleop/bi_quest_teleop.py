"""BiQuestTeleoperator — bimanual VR teleoperation via WebXR/Quest.

Subscribes to a relay-mode FastAPI server's `/ws` and reads `xr_frame`
broadcasts (controller poses + buttons + headset pose). Per arm,
maintains a `ClutchPoseMapper` and a `DecoupledIKSolver`; on the rising edge
of the grip button, captures the engage frame and starts running
differential IK each tick. `get_action()` returns the joint action
dict matching `YamUltraFollower.action_features`:

    {left,right}_joint_{1..6}.pos   (radians)
    {left,right}_gripper.pos        (normalized 0..1)

Standard LeRobot-style loop:

    teleop = BiQuestTeleoperator(BiQuestTeleoperatorConfig(...))
    follower = YamUltraFollower(...)
    teleop.connect(); follower.connect()
    while True:
        follower.send_action(teleop.get_action())
        time.sleep(1/freq)

Per-tick pipeline inside `_update_arm`:

  1. Staleness gate — if no `xr_frame` for > XR_FRAME_STALE_TIMEOUT_S,
     mark `needs_reanchor` and skip the tick. On the first fresh tick
     after recovery, the engage frame is silently re-captured so the
     delta-since-engage restarts at zero (no catch-up motion).
  2. EMA pose filter — smooths sub-tick WebXR jitter on the controller
     pose before downstream consumers see it (`pose_filter_alpha`).
  3. Precision button (A/X) — on transition, re-anchor the engage
     frame before changing the mapper gains. On the legacy absolute
     path this prevents the accumulated delta being reinterpreted
     under the new scale; on the reach-limited incremental path it simply
     realigns hand↔EE correspondence.
  4. Clutch edges — rising → `_anchor_mapper` (captures controller
     pose, EE pose, J4 anchor as rotation pivot, applies yaw
     correction); falling → mapper.disengage().
  5. Yaw correction — R_engage = R_CALIB · R_y(-yaw_now). R_CALIB is a
     fixed body→arm-base rotation; the runtime yaw_now subtraction
     keeps "controller forward" = "arm forward" wherever the operator
     happens to be facing in the room.
  6. IK step — FK at the last commanded qpos gives the current EE
     pose, passed into mapper.target() to enable the absorbing demand
     reach limits (rot_reach_limit / pos_reach_limit); DecoupledIKSolver.solve() then steps
     qpos[:6] toward the reach-limited target. Gripper qpos[6:8] mirrored
     from the trigger for the sim viewer.
  7. Haptic mix — max of (limit_pressure, pos_err_norm,
     singularity_proximity, wrist_gimbal_proximity); EMA-smoothed and
     broadcast in ik_state for the client to vibrate the matching
     controller.
